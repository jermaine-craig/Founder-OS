Great speaking with you yesterday. As discussed, I'm sending over the proposal for your review.

## Rules

1. **Default to reply-all** — Include all original recipients in Cc unless told otherwise
2. **Always show To, Cc, Subject** — Even if Cc is empty, include the field
3. **Use "Draft Reply" for replies, "Draft Email" for new emails**
4. **Always end with the approval question** — Never assume they want it added
5. **Keep the signature simple** — Just "Best," and the name
6. **Match the tone** — Professional but not stiff, match how they normally write
